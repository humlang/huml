The aim of this project is to create a somewhat general purpose programming language that sits at the sweet spot between performance and verification.
At the time of writing, some key aspects of it are:

  - Dependent Type System in the style of λΠω (calculus of constructions)
  - Supercompilation
  - ???
  - Profit.

This project is currently under heavy development.
Also, it is a side-project of mine, do not take it seriously.
Nevertheless, feel free to visit [https://hx-lang.org](https://hx-lang.org) for some outdated documentation.
